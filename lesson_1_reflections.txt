How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made it easy to compare only lines that had changed between the 2 versions. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Be able to reuse code. Enable you to recover from serious errors quicker.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You have to remember to do it. Creates a more controllable useful history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because they are specifically designed for projects using multiple related files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
first view all commits, then compare changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
don't need to worry about losing previous code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
my own projects
